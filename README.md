## Getting Started

This guide details how to set up the development environment for this React project.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (version 14 or later): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* Git version control (optional, but recommended): [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Steps

**1. Clone the Repository (if using Git)**

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Penstack-Inc/interview.git
```

**2. Navigate to the Project Directory**

```Bash
cd technical
```

**3. Install Dependencies**

The project uses a combination of npm packages for development and production. To install them all, run:

```Bash
npm install
```

Important Note: If you encounter setup errors during installation, you might need to force a reinstall of dependencies to ensure everything resolves correctly:

```Bash
npm install --force
```

**4. Start the Development Server**

The project utilizes Vite for development. To launch the development server and see the application running in your browser, execute:

```Bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically open your default browser at http://localhost:3000/ (the exact port may vary).

Development Scripts

The package.json file defines several scripts to streamline development tasks:

npm run dev: Starts the development server using Vite.
npm run preview: Starts a preview server using Vite (exact behavior might vary depending on project configuration).

Additional Notes: For more advanced usage or customization, refer to the documentation for Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, and other technologies used in this project.
By following these steps, you should be able to set up the development environment for your React project and start coding!
